John was walking down Langdon Street on his way to a party at his academic fraternity. It was a cold Thursday night, and he had a bunch of code to do, but he also wanted to go outside and meet up with his friends, so this is what he was doing instead.

He planned to leave the party around 12am so that he could have time to finish his code before the due time, which is tomorrow 9 o'clock in the morning. However, things weren't going as he thought. His friends talked him into a drinking game,and he had several huge cups of beer in just half. By the time he is supposed to leave, he felt that he wasn't able to walk and his head is really really dizzy


As John got out of the drinking game, he the dizziness becomes a halucination such that he saw something unimaginable. John 
thought to himself that this is just side-effect of drinking too much. As he is heading back home, he saw a big bright portal 
right in front of him. 

John just went through it and went back home. He did not write any code that night. He planned to get up early next morning. As a result of drinking too much, he did not get up early. He missed his due.
